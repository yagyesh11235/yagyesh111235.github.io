          <p class="lead">Data is invaluable in making Netflix such an exceptional service for our customers. Behind the scenes, we have a
            rich ecosystem of (big) data technologies facilitating our algorithms and analytics. We use and contribute to broadly-adopted open
            source technologies including Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Parquet, Presto, and Spark. In addition, we’ve developed and contributed some additional
            tools and services, which have further elevated our data platform. <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/genie">Genie</a> is a powerful, REST-based abstraction to our various
            data processing frameworks, notably Hadoop. <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/inviso">Inviso</a> provides detailed insights into the performance of our Hadoop jobs and
            clusters. <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/lipstick">Lipstick</a> shows the workflow of Pig jobs in a clear, visual fashion. And
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/aegisthus">Aegisthus</a> enables the bulk abstraction of data out of Cassandra for downstream analytic processing.</p>

          <h3>Taking code from desktop to the cloud</h3>
          <p class="lead">Netflix has open sourced many of our Gradle plugins under the name <a href="https://nebula-plugins.github.io/">Nebula</a>. Nebula started off as
            a set of strong opinions to make Gradle simple to use for our developers. But we quickly learned that we could use the same assumptions on our open source projects and
            on other Gradle plugins to make them easy to build, test and deploy. By standardizing plugin development, we've lowered the barrier to generating
            them, allowing us to keep our build modular and composable.</p>
          <p class="lead">We require additional tools to take these builds from the developers' desks to AWS. There are tens of thousands of instances
            running Netflix. Every one of these runs on top of an image created by our open source tool <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/aminator">Aminator</a>. Once packaged,
            these AMIs are deployed to AWS using our Continuous Delivery Platform, <a href="http://spinnaker.io">Spinnaker</a>. Spinnaker facilitates releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.

          <h3>Runtime containers, libraries and services that power microservices</h3>
          <p class="lead">The cloud platform is the foundation and technology stack for the majority of the services within Netflix. The cloud platform consists
            of cloud services, application libraries and application containers. Specifically, the platform provides service discovery through
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a>, distributed configuration through <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/archaius">Archaius</a>,
            resilent and intelligent inter-process and service communication through <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon">Ribbon</a>.  To provide reliability
            beyond single service calls, <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix">Hystrix</a> is provided to isolate latency and fault tolerance at runtime. The previous
            libraries and services can be used with any JVM based container.</p>
          <p class="lead">The platform provides JVM container services through
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/karyon">Karyon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/governator">Governator</a> and support for non-JVM runtimes
            via the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/prana">Prana</a> sidecar.  While Prana provides proxy capabilities within an instance,
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/zuul">Zuul</a> (which integrates Hystrix, Eureka, and Ribbon as part of its IPC capabilities) provides dyamically
            scriptable proxying at the edge of the cloud deployment.</p>
          <p class="lead">The platform works well within the EC2 cloud utilizing the Amazon autoscaler.  For container applications and batch jobs running on Apache Mesos,
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Fenzo">Fenzo</a> is a scheduler that provides advanced scheduling and resource management for cloud native frameworks.  Fenzo
            provides plugin implementations for bin packing, cluster autoscaling, and custom scheduling optimizations can be implemented through user-defined plugins.</p>

            is bounded by Hollywood master files that can be multiple terabytes in size, and cellular audio and video encodes which must provide an excellent
            customer experience at 200 Kilobits-per-second.  As part of the Netflix Digital Supply Chain, our encoding-related open-source efforts focus on tools
            and technologies that allow us meet the challenges of content ingest, and encoding, at scale.</p>
          <p class="lead"><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/photon">Photon</a> is a Java implementation of the Interoperable Master Format (IMF) standard.

            technology can meet every use case or satisfy every latency requirement. Our needs range from non-durable in-memory stores like Memcached, Redis, and <a href="http://hollow.how">Hollow</a>,
            to searchable datastores such as Elastic and durable must-never-go-down datastores like Cassandra and MySQL.</p>
          <p class="lead">Our Cloud usage and the scale at which we consume these technologies, has required us to build tools and services that enhance the
            datastores we use. We’ve created the sidecars <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Raigad">Raigad</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Priam">Priam</a> to help with the deployment, management and backup/recovery of our hundreds of Elastic and

            Memcached and Redis at scale. We’ve even developed the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/dyno">Dyno</a> client library to better consume Dynomite

          <p class="lead">Telemetry and metrics play a critical role in the operations of any company, and at more than a billion metrics per minute flowing into
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/atlas">Atlas</a>, our time-series telemetry platform, they play a critical role at Netflix.  However, Operational
            Insight is considered a higher-order family of products at Netflix, including the ability to understand the current components of our cloud ecosystem
            via <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/edda">Edda</a>, and the easy integration of Java application code with Atlas via the
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/spectator">Spectator</a> library.</p>
          <p class="lead">Effective performance instrumentation allows engineers to drill quickly on a massive volume of metrics, making critical decisions quickly
            and efficiently.  <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vector">Vector</a> exposes high-resolution host-level metrics with minimal overhead.
          <p class="lead">Being able to understand the current state of our complex microservice architecture at a glance is crucial when making remediation decisions.
            <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vizceral">Vizceral</a> helps provide this at-a-glance intuition without needing to first build up a mental model of the system.</p>

            to make security teams more efficient and effective when securing large and dynamic environments.</p>
          <p class="lead"><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/security_monkey">Security Monkey</a> helps monitor and secure large AWS-based environments, allowing
            security teams to identify potential security weaknesses. <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/scumblr">Scumblr</a> is an intelligence gathering tool that
            leverages Internet-wide targeted searches to surface specific security issues for investigation.
	    <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/stethoscope">Stethoscope</a> is a web application that collects information from existing systems management tools
	    (e.g., JAMF or LANDESK) on a given employee’s devices and gives them clear and specific recommendations for securing their systems.</p>

          <h3>Libraries to help you build rich client applications</h3>
          <p class="lead">Every month, Netflix members around the world discover and watch more than ten billion hours of movies and shows on their TV, mobile
            and desktop devices. Using modern UI technologies like Node.js, React and RxJS, our engineers build rich client applications that run across thousands
            of devices. We strive to create cinematic, immersive experiences that delight our members, exhibit exceptional performance and work flawlessly. We're
            continuously improving the product through data-driven A/B testing that enables us to experiment with novel concepts and understand the value of every
            feature we ship.</p>
          <p class="lead">We created <a href="https://netflix.github.io/falcor">Falcor</a> for efficient data fetching. We help maintain
            <a href="https://github.com/restify/node-restify">Restify</a> to enable us to scale Node.js applications with full observability. We're
            helping to build the next version of <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS">RxJS</a> to improve its performance and debuggability.</p>
